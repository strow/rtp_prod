% function airs_l1b_era_umw(sdate, edate, root)
%
%   Acumulate AIRS data from sdate to edate, add model
%   and compute radiances. 
%
%   Input:
%   sdate - matlab start date 
%   edate - matlab end date

%   Optional Input: 
%   root  - Root directory of the data tree (default = "$PWD/dump/")
%           For most of the code we assume 
%           that files are saved bellow a "root" 
%           directory: 
%           $root/data/rtprod_airs/....
%           
%           This is a bit rigid, but lets you have 
%           your own repository of data with the same
%           file structure.
