%   Compute the matching AIRS L1B granule for a givem matlab time,
%   accurate to 1/1000th of 6 minutes (granule size) - which is 0.36s.
%   This is necessary because of innacurate decimal matlab times 
%   representing precise time fractions. This limit could be pushed further.

% Compute which AIRS granule falls in the given mdate

% ALTHOUGH AIRS granules start 5m32s later than the integer boundaries 
% of "decihours", we will assume they start right at the boundary.
% Hence one day of AIRS data actually goes from 00:05:32 to 00:05:32 of the 
% next day. And all smaller time spans will have this 5:32 offset.
% Live with this for now....
